>Obtain the top 10 donors over the whole dataset bitcoin in 2009 to December 2014  for the Wikileaks bitcoin address: **{1HB5XMLmzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v}**. Found the information on who these wallets belong to. Found out how much was being donated if converted into pounds.

To achieve this task I used dataframes of pyspark. First we need to filter the data from whole vout files which are based on wikileaks bitcoin address: **{1HB5XMLmzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v}**.
